		<h2>To start my introduction to the class, I guess I can start by saying that I am a double major in graphic design and art education. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I grew up in Buck County, in a small town called Newtown. I started a passion for graphic design when I was a senior in high school but my true passion is teaching. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I am currently a senior at Millersville but will be completing a fifth year to complete my second degree. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Some hobbies or passions of mine are reading for fun (I know boring), playing with my dog when I am home, watching TV and listening to music. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I grew a deeper passion for web design over the last year or so and am looking forward to how this class will help me improve my skills. That is why I choose to take this course.
		</p>
		<p>
		Along with this class, I have full course load with design courses including, Portfilio, Computer Art and Vis Comm ll. I am also taking an art education class and have two after school jobs. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I hope after graduation to start teaching graphic design in a technical school or high school. Being a double major will help with getting a job.</h2>
